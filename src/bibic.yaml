about: |
    This application allows the conversion of any integer from one representation (a numeral system) to another. A numeral system is represented by its digits which can be any combination of UTF-8 chars. For example, "0", "1" will represent binary.

after_help: |+
    The following numeral systems are pre-integrated into the application and can be used :
      - dec for decimal
      - hex for hexadecimal
      - bin for binay
      - base58 for base 58 used in bitcoin address representation
      - bibi for bibi-binary as defined by Boby Lapointe, the inspirator of this application
      - budu for an experimental numeral system which is well readable
      - utf8 for an experimental numeral system which is a combination of serveral utf8 symbols

    Numeral systems can also be described by a json file

    Example 1 : representation of binary in a file
    {
        "prefix":"0b",
        "digits":["0","1"]
    }

    Example 2 : bibi system
    {
        "prefix":"",
        "digits":[["H", "B", "K", "D"],["O", "A", "E", "I"]]
    }
